# Azoth

Discord bot made in Rust

## Currently available commands

- `ping` replies back with a pong
- `github`: checks
- `quiz`: gets random question from the open trivia database

## Still needs implementing

- [ ] Run the code in the `github` command on a timer and auto send message based on result
- [ ] `quiz` gets 1 question from the trivia API and person who requested the original question can answer with a reply
  - [ ] questions can be answered as a react
  - [ ] questions can be answered from embeded buttons (need to check discord api to see how that is doable, example from Aether Hunts discord server)
